<Notes>
Let's dig a little bit deeper in pages and layouts. As mentioned in the previous slide, layouts are a way to define the layout for a set of pages. The important part here is that layouts can be nested. If you are leveraging nextjs link component and client side navigation only the part in the layout will change when navigating between pages. This is gives a very smooth and stable user experience where you can have this main shell and only swap out the content that really changes.

So let's what that can look like.
