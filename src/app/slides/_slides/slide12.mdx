# What did we learn?

<Notes>
Next.js is a opinionated way of writing applications, you can't accept those opinions you are better off with using something else. Of course there are things I might not like 100%, but I understand why it is like so and accept it since I consider the upside of not having to reinvent everything myself much bigger than figuring out all the things that I get from nextjs by myself. I want to focus as much as possible on delivering vavlue to our customers and if I can "buy" myself some slack by using something existing I am 100% fine with that.
