# What did we learn?

<Notes>

Given that next.js is a very opinionated way of writing applications, I would say that you have to either accept those opinions or you might be better of using something else. There are a lot of other great options out there, so don't be stuck in something you don't enjoy working with. There are of course things I don't agree 100% with, but I understand why it is like so and accept it since I consider the upside of not having to reinvent everything myself much bigger than figuring out all the things that I get from nextjs by myself. I want to focus as much as possible on delivering vavlue to our customers and if I can "buy" myself some slack by using something existing I am 100% fine with that.
