<Notes>
React server components is probably one of the largest changes nextjs has pushed into the react ecosystem with nextjs 13. As I see it this is not something 100% new and more how it has been on other runtimes for a long time, but we have been focusing too much on creating SPAs so we have forgot about it. Doing the initial rendering on the server is how I think it should be, and then you just sprinkle some client side magic dust where you need it. This leads to faster applications and less javascript on the client which I think is a good thing. It also simplifies a lot when it comes to application infrastructure since you often can get rid of the whole BFF in a lot of scenarios, instead you can just get the data you need on the server and serve the finished HTML.
