# High level choices

<Notes>
The proposal we had was to move to nextjs and leverage server side rendering much more, but still had a very decent foundation to create dynamic parts where needed. From a pure performance perspective there could be smarter choices, but we have to take both the existing pool of developers and potential future pool of development. Pushing for newer and more experimental things require that a significant pool of developers wants to work with said technology. At the moment we don't have a pool of developers that want to work with Svelte, htmx, clojurescript or fable... so the logical choice is to pick something that is safe, and in the current web landscape I don't think there is anything safer than React to be honest.

Nextjs is just a very opinionated way of writing react, which helps solve a lot of problems around building and deploying the application out of the box.

React is a safe bet.
