# How do you get to do such a rewrite in the first place?

<Notes>
From previous experiences I do know that it can some times be hard for developers to really drive the change they want to make. A lot of the times those decisions are made by what people often call business, which is like saying IT is not business. This is more true in larger organizations than startups so I thought I would share a couple of words on how I think you need to approach this go actually drive change in a large organization.
