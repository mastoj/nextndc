<Notes>
Since the above might not be the area of expertise that you specialize in, pairing up with one or more people might be a good idea. Preferably someone that complements you and also can help challenge what you want to do to check if it even make sense. In my specific scenario I got help from three people I would say. Two other developers so we could make a really rough proof of concept and one more person to help create a solid business case. This was crucial for me to be able to drive the change I wanted to make.
